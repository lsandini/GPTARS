# 3D Models for GPTARS

This folder contains all the 3D printable files needed to create the physical structure of GPTARS.

## Included Files
- **Chassis parts**: The main frame of GPTARS.
- **Servo mounts**: Components to secure servos for movement.
- **LCD holder**: A mount for the LCD/OLED display.

## Instructions
1. Use a 3D printer to print the models provided in this folder.
2. Ensure all components are printed with a resolution of 0.2 mm or finer for accuracy.
3. For materials, **PLA** or **ABS** is recommended for structural strength.

### Example Filenames
- `chassis_part_1.stl`
- `servo_mount.stl`
- `lcd_holder.stl`

### Contribution
If youâ€™d like to contribute new or updated 3D models, please ensure they fit the standard Raspberry Pi and servo dimensions used in this project.
